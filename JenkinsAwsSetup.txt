1. From the AWS Management Console, launch the Amazon EC2 instance
from an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that has the base operating
system you want.

2. Choose a security group that will allow SSH access as well as port 80 or
8080 to access your Jenkins dashboard. You should only enable ingress
from the IP addresses you wish to allow access to your server. See
Securing Network Access to the Master Node for more
details.

3. Connect to the instance via SSH.17

4. Update the yum package management tool.

$ sudo yum update –y

5. Download the latest Jenkins code package.

$ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins.repo

6. Import a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package.

$ sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key

7. Install Jenkins.

$ sudo yum install jenkins -y

8. Start Jenkins as a service.

$ sudo service jenkins start

9. Configure Jenkins, now that it’s installed and running on your Amazon
EC2 instance. Use its management interface at port 80 or 8080, or
remotely access the server via SSH. In its default configuration, Jenkins
versions 2.0 and later lock down access to the management interface.
