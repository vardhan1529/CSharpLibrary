Steps: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. From the AWS Management Console, launch the Amazon EC2 instance
from an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that has the base operating
system you want.

2. Choose a security group that will allow SSH access as well as port 80 or
8080 to access your Jenkins dashboard. You should only enable ingress
from the IP addresses you wish to allow access to your server. See
Securing Network Access to the Master Node for more
details.

3. Connect to the instance via SSH.17

4. Update the yum package management tool.

$ sudo yum update –y

5. Download the latest Jenkins code package.

$ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins.repo

6. Import a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package.

$ sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key

7. Install Jenkins.

$ sudo yum install jenkins -y

8. Start Jenkins as a service.

$ sudo service jenkins start

-------------------------------
An error may occure if the java version is not the latest.
Upgrade the java version

9. Configure Jenkins, now that it’s installed and running on your Amazon
EC2 instance. Use its management interface at port 80 or 8080, or
remotely access the server via SSH. In its default configuration, Jenkins
versions 2.0 and later lock down access to the management interface.

The first time you use the dashboard at http://<your-serveraddress>:8080,
you will be prompted to unlock Jenkins:
--------------------------------
Use this in putty to get the key.

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword


------------------------------------------------------------------------

To integrate the github to jenkins:

1. Install Git in the jenkin server.
2. Add Git/Github Plugins.
3. Configure the pipeline or job with the github repository.
4. Make sure that the global configuration settings has no issues with the git path.
5. Enable GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling option in the build triggers.
6. In the github account -> settings -> Integration & Services -> Add a webhook for jenkins.
7. In the webhook url add the <Jenkins Server url>/github-webhook/
ex: http://ec2-13-126-230-34.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/github-webhook/

Now the build triggers when a commit is done in the repository
